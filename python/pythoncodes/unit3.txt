1. I/O Interface
Bridge between CPU and peripherals.

Handles communication and command/data transfer.

2. PCI Bus (Peripheral Component Interconnect)
High-speed parallel bus for internal components.

Supports plug-and-play and multiple devices.

3. SCSI Bus (Small Computer System Interface)
Parallel interface used for connecting multiple peripherals.

Daisy-chaining support with high transfer speeds.

4. USB (Universal Serial Bus)
Standard for serial communication with external devices.

Plug-and-play, hot-swappable, universal support.

5. Data Transfer Modes
Serial: 1 bit at a time, long-distance.

Parallel: Multiple bits, short-distance, faster.

Synchronous: Clock-based coordination.

Asynchronous: Start/stop bits, no clock dependency.

6. Direct Memory Access (DMA)
Transfers data directly between memory and I/O.

Frees CPU, fast and efficient.
